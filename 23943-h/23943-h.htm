<h2>
    PREFACE.
</h2>
<p>
I have written this little chicken book in the past few months, and now
on my eleventh birthday the story is finished.
</p>
<p>
The "other critters" have talked to the world through "Uncle Remus." The
horses through "Black Beauty"; now I wish to give the chickens a chance.
</p>
<p>
Most of them I write of are members of my own family, so I know them
well.

<h2>
    CHAPTER FIRST.
</h2>
<h3>
    A TALK IN THE CHICKENYARD.
</h3>
<p>
"Why is it, I would like to know," said young Scratchfoot, throwing the
sand over himself, "that every one is talking and carrying on of a hot
Summer day the very time you ought to go to sleep?"
</p>
<p>
"Hush up, Scratchfoot," said Topknot, "we are having a very lively
conversation. Uncle Red Nose Mike has just asked a riddle, which none
of us can guess. But you can, so get up and try."
</p>
<p>
Scratchfoot yawned and then said, "Mr. Mike, what is your riddle? I will
try my hand at it. What is it?"
</p>
<p>
"What kind of a cravat would our friend Mr. Hog be most likely to
choose?" said Red Nose

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>[6]</span>

                       Mike, then added: "I have offered a prize of
those six worms I found just now to the one that tells me what it is."
</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ill-06.jpg" width="500" height="505"
alt="HEN CASTLE." />
<br />
HEN CASTLE.
</div>

<p>
"That is very easy. Have these people, sensible too they call
themselves, been trying so long to guess that riddle? Hand over your

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span>

 worms, Mr. Mike, for I know it," said Scratchfoot after a little
thought.
</p>
<p>
"The worms come after the riddle," said Mike.
</p>
<p>
"The answer is a pig's tie."
</p>
<p>
"Right, and here are the worms!"
</p>
<p>
Then after receiving many congratulations Scratchfoot ate the worms.
</p>
<h3>
LATER, IN THE HENHOUSE.
</h3>
<p>
"Mrs. Henny Penny, why do you insist on sitting on your nest forever?
It is so pleasant outdoors; you might be fattening on worms instead of
up here on your nest as if you were glued to it," said Scratchfoot.
</p>
<p>
"My dear, I see you do not understand."
</p>
<p>
"No, I don't understand, and only silly people say there is anything to
understand in it," said Scratchfoot, interrupting Henny Penny.
</p>
<p>
"Dear, you said awhile ago that no one ought to stay in this fine
weather, so I wish you would please go out."
</p>
<p>
After giving her a peck Scratchfoot left the house.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER SECOND.
</h2>
<h3>
    DEATH OF SCRATCHFOOT.
</h3>
<p>
"O! Mr. Mike, what is that noise? O! O! Mr. Mike, it is Scratchfoot; he
has fallen. See, Mr. Mike," said Brownie, one of the hens at Fowl Farm.
</p>
<p>
Red Nose Mike flew down on the floor of the henhouse. Then he gave a cry
that waked all the chickens. He said, "Ladies and gentlemen, please all
get together and listen to this sad news I have to tell you."
</p>
<p>
All the people assembled, and Red Nose Mike said&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Knowing as I do that young Scratchfoot, of our beloved Fowl Farm, has
gotten up such a reputation, not only for finding the nicest, fattest
worms, not only for guessing riddles or telling the best stories, but
for fighting off any rooster that does harm to the people, I wish to
break the dreadful news as best I can that Scratchfoot is dead!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>
Every hen and every rooster drew out their kerchiefs and freely the
tears fell. It was dawn before any of them stopped crying. Then
preparations were made to bury Scratchfoot. Every chicken went; even
Henny Penny left her eggs long enough to go.
</p>
<p>
That night every one was weak with crying and Topknot had cried herself
sick.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER THIRD.
</h2>
<h3>
    FOWL FARM.
</h3>
<p>
Fowl Farm was once owned by a farmer named Gray, but when Mr. Gray died
he left his farm to a friend who cared nothing at all about it, and
never took the trouble to go to it or to sell it or to send any one else
to it. So once, nearly five years after Mr. Gray's death, some half
dozen travelling hens and roosters found it, and after coming to the
conclusion that it was as much theirs as any one's, they took possession
of it and have kept it ever since.
</p>
<p>
Here are the names of the hens:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Lady Gray, Henny Penny, Fluffie, Speckle, Mrs. Bluehen, Topknot,
Brownie, Eatwell, Stuffie, Cockletop, Swellhead, Tiptoe, Highhead,
Julia, Charcoal, Glover, Bluie, Longlegs, and Bigfoot.
</p>
<p>
Here are the names of the roosters:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Red Nose Mike, Lazybones, Long Nose Bill.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER FOURTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    THE PARTY.
</h3>
<p>
"Mr. Long Nose, have you been for the mail?" asked Cockletop, as Long
Nose was returning from a walk.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Bill, "I called. Only a letter for Lady Gray, though.
Here, Lazybones, take this to the lady."
</p>
<p>
Lazybones never objected to taking mail to Lady Gray, because she always
gave him something.
</p>
<p>
That night Lady Gray's maid came to the second henhouse and handed a
folded paper to Red Nose Mike. He opened it and read:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "<i>Mr. Mike</i>:
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;I wish all of you to come to Hen Castle at eight
    o'clock to-night.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "<span class="sc">Lady Gray.</span>"
</p>
<p>
Red Nose called all the people together and read aloud the note. They
all, except Henny

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span>

                  Penny, said they would go. Then Mike seated himself
at the table and wrote:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "<i>Lady Gray</i>:
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "<span class="sc">Dear Madam</span>:&mdash;We will all be very glad to come to the Castle
    to-night at the appointed hour. Mrs. H. Penny says you really must
    excuse her though, as she is setting.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "Respectfully,
</p>
<p class="quote">
        "<span class="sc">R. N. Mike.</span>"
</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ill-12.jpg" width="500" height="535"
alt="RED NOSE MIKE." />
<br />
RED NOSE MIKE.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>
This answer met with great approval in the henhouse, and at seven
o'clock every hen was getting out her silk dresses and saying what they
looked best in.
</p>
<p>
Promptly at eight every one was at the Castle. Lady Gray met them in the
garden and said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I received by to-day's mail a very kind invitation to go to a party
over at Chicken Place. You were all invited. It is to be to-morrow, from
seven in the evening until one in the morning. All who wish to go will
oblige me by saying 'I.'"
</p>
<p>
Every one said "I." Then the chickens left to get ready for the party.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER FIFTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    HENNY PENNY.
</h3>
<p>
"After the thing was all over and the company leaving, Lady Featherly
gave each of us an orange or an apple," said Speckle to Henny Penny
the day after the party. "Don't you wish you had been there?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, my dear, and I could have gone for half an hour, if I had not to
go out buying that house to-day. I may have to be gone some time, but
the only thing I mind is about my eggs. I am afraid they will get cold."
Henny sighed as she spoke.
</p>

<div class="figure" style="float:left;">
<img src="images/ill-14.jpg" width="300" height="317"
alt="" />
</div>

<p>
"Could I take your place?"
</p>
<p>
"I would be very much obliged, my dear."
</p>
<p>
"Then I will," said Speckle. "What time do you go?"
</p>
<p>
"Red Nose Mike will be ready at half-past four this afternoon," Henny
said.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>
Speckle was ready at the time set by Henny, who soon found a house and
was back in an hour's time.
</p>
<p>
We must now hear something of Henny Penny. She is one of the oldest and
sweetest hens at Fowl Farm. She was a small chicken when the travelling
hens and roosters settled at the farm. She is respected by every decent
chicken that ever saw her. The remark is everywhere, "What a nice lady
that Mrs. Henny Penny is!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER SIXTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    TOPKNOT GOES AWAY.
</h3>
<p>
"Topknot, the doctor says go away for a month or so, and as old Miss
Guinea has asked you often to come to see her you may as well go now,"
said Long Nose Bill as he came in. He had been to see the doctor about
Topknot, who was sick. "I know, Mr. Bill, I am very much obliged to you
for having called on Doctor Fixit for me. I suppose I will have to go
at once if Miss Guinea wants me now."
</p>

<div class="figure" style="float:left;">
<img src="images/ill-16.jpg" width="300" height="298"
alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Topknot wrote and heard in a day or so, saying Miss Guinea would be very
glad to see her any time she would come. So Monday morning found Top, as
the people called her, at the Guinea Place.
</p>
<p>
She stayed a month and came back as well as ever.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER SEVENTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    A LITTLE FUSS.
</h3>
<p>
"Well, I hope he will get it done by Spring," said Red Nose Mike. He had
been giving Lazybones some instructions about digging sweet potatoes,
which he had offered to pay him for.
</p>
<p>
"I hope he will too," said Henny Penny.
</p>
<p>
"You all ought not to be so hard on Lazybones. You know the
circumstances."
</p>
<p>
"O hush, Speckle. You are always taking up for Lazybones."
</p>
<p>
"What did you say about circumstances, Speckle?" asked Stuffie.
</p>
<p>
"We were talking about Lazybones, Stuff," said Mrs. Bluehen. "We were
rather too hard on him, and Speck said we knew the circumstances."
</p>
<p>
"What sort of circumstances, Speck?"
</p>
<p>
"Stuff," said Speck, "I did not know you were here, and you raised
Lazybones. I was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[18]</span>

                 going to explain the circumstances, but I had rather
not as you are here."
</p>
<p>
"Do you mean that I raised Lazybones to be lazy?"
</p>
<p>
"I do, Stuff."
</p>
<p>
"Am I lazy?"
</p>
<p>
"I think so."
</p>
<p>
"Why dare you say that, miss?"
</p>
<p>
"Why did you ask me?"
</p>
<p>
"Because I wanted to know."
</p>
<p>
"I said what I thought, Stuff."
</p>
<p>
"O, hush up, Stuffie; don't talk so to Speckle. Ask a reasonable
question and answer reasonably," said Mike.
</p>
<p>
"Very well, Mr. Mike," said Stuffie, who, truth to tell, was afraid of
Red Nose.
</p>
<p>
The end of it was that Stuffie, being so mad, got the worst of it. She
went to her nest to mope the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Lady Gray heard how nicely Speckle behaved. She sent and asked her to
dine at the Castle. You may be sure Speck went.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER EIGHTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    A LITTLE FUN.
</h3>
<p>
"High! high! for the first cold day. It makes me feel good," said Long
Nose Bill on the tenth of December.
</p>
<p>
"What shall we do to-day?" asked Fluffie.
</p>
<p>
"Suppose we get the sleds and go to the hill!"
</p>
<p>
"What for?"
</p>
<p>
"To slide, of course, Fluff."
</p>
<p>
"Are we all going?"
</p>
<p>
"That is just what I want to find out."
</p>
<p>
Long Nose Bill got up and made this speech:
</p>
<p>
"<span class="sc">Ladies and Gentlemen of Fowl Farm</span>: Please, your attention for
a second.
</p>
<p>
"We ought not to let such a fine snowstorm go by without going over to
the hill. The sleds are all in order, and I move we lose no time in
going over to the hill. We could spend an hour or so very pleasantly in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[20]</span>

 sliding. All who are of my opinion will oblige me by saying 'I.'"
</p>
<p>
With this fine speech, as Fluffie called it, Bill sat down.
</p>
<p>
All the people said "I," so at once they started. What a good time they
had! Once Speckle disappeared, but soon Red Nose Mike saw her head
sticking up out of a snowbank.
</p>
<p>
After awhile they went home. The close of a short December afternoon was
upon them before they reached the house.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Mike," said Brownie, as they walked home together, "let's tell some
stories to-night!"
</p>
<p>
"Very well; I am willing if the others are."
</p>
<p>
The others were not only willing but glad, so after supper they began.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER NINTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    CHAT AND NEWS.
</h3>
<p>
All and every one of Fowl Farm on a cold Winter afternoon were seated in
the sitting room at the second hen house. Lady Gray and Lady Featherly
had come in to spend a sociable afternoon, as they said. Lady Featherly
had her embroidery, Lady Gray her knitting. The others were sewing.
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Penny, may I ask what article of dress you are making?" asked Lady
Featherly.
</p>
<p>
"Only hemstitching an apron, lady."
</p>
<p>
"May I see it?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly."
</p>
<p>
Henny unfolded, as she spoke, a beautiful apron. It was embroidered in
forget-me-nots, which were sprinkled over it. Fluffie laughed and told
Speckle afterwards that Lady Featherly nearly had a fit when she saw it.
For she said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"O, Mrs. Penny, how beautiful. Thought you

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[22]</span>

                                           did not embroider." Then
turning to Lady Gray, "Look here, Cousin Gray, see how lovely this is."
</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ill-22.jpg" width="500" height="524"
alt="A GROUP IN THE YARD." />
<br />
A GROUP IN THE YARD.
</div>

<p>
Soon every one was admiring Henny's work.
</p>
<p>
"May I ask who you are making it for, Mrs. Penny?"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>
"For sale."
</p>
<p>
"How much do you ask?"
</p>
<p>
"Five dollars!"
</p>
<p>
"I will buy it then. I will pay you now."
</p>
<p>
Looking in her purse she drew forth an eight dollar bill, handed it to
Henny, and said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Penny, here is a bill for your apron. When you finish it please
send it to my home at Chicken Place. I hope it is right. Is it?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, my dear lady, it is too right. I only asked five dollars for the
apron. You have given me eight."
</p>
<p>
"Five dollars is not enough for such exquisite work. So please accept
eight."
</p>
<p>
"Why, thank you very much, my dear lady," said Henny.
</p>
<p>
"Fluffie, dear, you look badly. What is the matter?" asked Lady Gray
about an hour later.
</p>
<p>
"I feel rather badly, too, Lady Gray. I think we have been having too
much fuss down here. I will try to stay in my nest more."
</p>
<p>
"Fluffie, I want to ask you and Henny and Speck up to the Castle if you
will come," said Lady Gray.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>
"If we will come! We certainly will. We will be delighted to come to the
Castle on a visit."
</p>
<p>
"Fluffie, I don't want you on a visit. I want you there to live. How
would you like that?" asked Lady Gray.
</p>
<p>
"O, my dearest lady. Do you mean it?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I certainly mean it."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    CHAPTER TENTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    TROUBLE AT FOWL FARM.
</h3>
<p>
"Squark! squark! squark!" went Stuffie, Highhead, Longlegs, and Bigfoot.
It was just after the clock had struck for midnight. Red Nose Mike woke
up to find the door open and some one, he could not tell who, standing
there with the people in his hand. He was reaching for Charcoal. Mike at
once woke Charcoal and the rest of them escaped. Soon the person, whom
Red Nose Mike could see was not a chicken, disappeared.
</p>
<p>
"O! O! where are they? Who was it? O! Cousin Red Nose!" said Eatwell.
</p>
<p>
"No time for this, Eatwell," said Mrs. Bluehen. "Mr. Bill, Mr. Bill,
where are you?"
</p>
<p>
"Right here, putting on my overcoat. I must go up to the Castle and warn
the people of the danger," answered Bill.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I was just going to say you ought to go."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>
Bill was gone. Did he ever reach the Castle? We will see.

THE TRAMP.
</div>

<p>
As soon as he got outside the door the first thing Bill did was to put
his ear down to the ground. But he heard nothing. Then on he went. But
no, his legs would not carry him

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[27]</span>

                                  fast enough. He flew. At last the
Castle came in sight. How was he to get in? He knew. There was a porch,
a top porch, and Lady Gray's bay window opened into it. Bill flew on
the porch and commenced pecking on the window.
</p>
<p>
Lady Gray was easy to wake. She was soon at the window. She raised it
and said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Bill, what do you mean? This is rather late to pay calls."
</p>
<p>
"O, lady, it is not a call. I came to tell you that serious trouble has
come to dear Fowl Farm," said Bill.
</p>
<p>
Lady Gray was a person not easily frightened, so she said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I hope it is not as serious as you think; but what is it?"
</p>
<p>
"My dear madam, a tramp came to our house and stole Stuffie, Highhead,
Longlegs, and Bigfoot. Dear lady, he may come here, so please send out
to see if he has left the farm."
</p>
<p>
This was too much for Lady Gray. She fainted.

    CHAPTER ELEVENTH.

<h3>
    LADY GRAY'S ILLNESS.
</h3>
<p>
"How is the lady this morning?" asked Red Nose Mike the next day.
</p>
<p>
"Worse!" said Brownie, who was a trained nurse.
</p>
<p>
Mike sighed. "Is there anything I can do?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, go for Doctor Fixit. She won't hear of a doctor coming, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Red Nose Mike was gone before she could say more. An hour and a half
later Brownie, Henny, and the doctor were on the Castle porch.
</p>
<p>
"What do you think, doctor?" asked Henny.
</p>
<p>
"My dear madam, she has been worked up and is very badly off. She must
be kept very quiet. Those powders I left on the table must be taken the
last thing before going to bed and the first thing in the morning. She
must eat nothing. Make her some beef tea."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>
"How often must she take that?" asked Brownie.
</p>
<p>
"Every four hours. If she wants it break up a cracker in it. Good
morning; I will see you in the afternoon." The doctor left.
</p>
<p>
"Fluffie," said Brownie, "go lay down; see if you can catch a minute's
sleep. You will be sick next."
</p>
<p>
Fluffie went to her room and laid down. Lady Gray had been sick a week
now, and though she was a little better to-day she was far from being
well.
</p>
<p>
While she lay there the doctor came up to the door.
</p>
<p>
Up she jumped and went to open the door.
</p>
<p>
"How is she, Miss Fluffie?"
</p>
<p>
"About the same." As Fluffie spoke she and the doctor went across the
hall to Lady Gray's room. The doctor went in.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes Speckle came in Fluffie's room and said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Fluff, the doctor says Lady Gray will soon be well. She is now very
much better than we thought."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>
"Yes, Speck, I heard him say so before I came in here."
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later Lady Gray was down on the porch. She still looked thin
and pale, but now would soon be well.

    CHAPTER TWELFTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    A STORY.
</h3>
<p>
"Fluffie, come here; I have some news," said Lady Gray three years after
the stealing of Stuffie, Highhead, Longlegs, and Bigfoot. Lady Featherly
had long ago returned to Chicken Place. Everything had gone on quietly
at Fowl Farm.
</p>
<p>
"What is your news, lady?" asked Fluffie.
</p>
<p>
"You remember, Fluff," said the lady, "that visit we made over at Beauty
Spot?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"You remember Tanglelegs?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"Well, she wants to come up for the Winter."
</p>
<p>
"My dear lady, we don't want her up here," said Fluff.
</p>
<p>
"So I think, but we can't tell her not to come. Mrs. Bluehen has a house
full. She can't take her."
</p>
<p>
"I have an idea, lady. You know Blackie

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span>

                                        and Tiptoe are in the old house.
Why couldn't she go with them?"
</p>
<p>
"Just it. I will write to Tangle now."
</p>
<p>
"Cousin Mike," said Tanglelegs, a day after her arrival at Fowl Farm,
"it is a very hot afternoon. We can't sleep. Won't you please tell a
story?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, yes. What do you want to hear?" asked Red Nose.
</p>
<p>
"Anything."
</p>
<p>
"Well, one morning about nine years ago, when we were young, we belonged
to a family who lived about fifteen miles from here. They had all kinds
of fowls, turkeys, ducks, and everything. One night our mistress came
with her maid and examined us closely. She decided she had too many
chickens, so half a dozen of us were stopped up ready to be sold in the
morning. After awhile other chickens came to talk to us and we found out
a way to get out.
</p>
<p>
"We sent for our friend the dog, or as we called him, Sir Dixie. He
came. We asked him to stand up on his hind legs and push the door of the
box we were in with his nose

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>[33]</span>

                             and then we could fly out. Sir Dixie was
very glad to help us, so we soon got out, but we could not stay there
any longer, for of course it was not safe. So we started out, and after
awhile reached Fowl Farm. And we have, as you see, been here ever
since."

    CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.
</h2>
<h3>
    WEDDINGS, SONGS, A PICNIC.
</h3>
<p>
Lady Gray had a great many visitors that Winter. One, Mr. Long Neck
Cock, who she had known for years, was spending the Winter with her.
Cock and Speckle got to be great friends.
</p>
<p>
The Winter was almost over, but March winds did not, as expected,
blow Cock away.
</p>
<p>
In April, Julia married Red Nose Mike, who died in a week after the
wedding.
</p>
<p>
April was gone, and the first day of the lovely month of May came. Cock
still remained at the Castle.
</p>
<p>
On the fifth of May cards were sent out to all their friends announcing
the marriage of Miss Speckle and Mr. L. N. Cock. The wedding took place
on the fifteenth.
</p>
<p>
Lady Gray made them the present of a house very near the Castle.
</p>
<p>
In honor of the occasion Julia and Glover got up a picnic. Every one
went. They had a very

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[35]</span>

                      good time. As the day was drawing to a close and
every one had assembled to go home Long Nose Bill commenced singing this
song in honor of Julia and Glover:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "Miss Julie was a chicken of the old blue hen: </p>
<p class="i3">    The way she 'fit' it was a sin. </p>
<p class="i3">    She boxed my ears and sot 'em a ringing, </p>
<p class="i3">    She never said a word, but she went along a singing. </p>
<p class="i3">    O, Miss Julie Glover, my true lover, </p>
<p class="i3">    Stuck in the mud and can't turn over. </p>
<p class="i3">    O, Miss Julie G-l-o-v-e-r!" </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Eight years have now passed. All is as usual at Fowl Farm. Lady Gray is
dead. But Lady Fluffie almost equals her in everything.
</p>
<p>
Dear old Henny Penny is just the same Henny Penny we left some years
ago. She, of course, is much older.
</p>
<p>
Speckle and her rooster, as Lady Fluff says, have a large and constantly
increasing family, which now numbers fifteen. But in spite of all these
changes we can say with Mrs. Bluehen, Fowl Farm is just the same old
Fowl Farm and never can be anything else.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
